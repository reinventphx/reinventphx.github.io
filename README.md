[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reinventphx/reinventphx.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reinventphx/reinventphx.github.io)

This is a dashboard page for displaying the data on [this google spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JvF5lyj5h_5DgLOBItflwd7438dF0aSuCtqDaN2CMt8/edit?usp=sharing)

Each year (or as often as nessisary) the new data will be added to the spreadhseet and this site should pull the live graphs directly from the google spreadsheet. A focus on the change per year will need to be taken after we have more than one years worth of data.



## Jekyll

This repository uses Jekyll for a file based CMS.  GitHub IO pages support Jekyll automatically, so no set up is required.  

For more about Jekyll, checkout https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll. 

For more about Jekyll with Pages, checkout https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/. 


## Getting started developing these pages locally: 
````
 gem install bundler
 bundle install
 bundle exec jekyll serve
````
This site should be available at ```http://localhost:4000``` and it will auto rebuild if any files change.
