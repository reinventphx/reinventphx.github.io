This is a dashboard page for displaying the data on [this google spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JvF5lyj5h_5DgLOBItflwd7438dF0aSuCtqDaN2CMt8/edit?usp=sharing)

Each year (or as often as nessisary) the new data will be added to the spreadhseet and this site should pull the live graphs directly from the google spreadsheet. A focus on the change per year will need to be taken after we have more than one years worth of data.
